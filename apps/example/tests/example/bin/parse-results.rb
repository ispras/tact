# This class implements basic parser functionality.  It assumes test output has the following

# This output consists of several chunks, each printed by a distinct script.

class AppResultsParser < ResultsParserBase

    # This implementation assumes that each test is run once within a testsuite, and NUM_REPETITIONS
    # defines the number of times test suite is run. I.e. this implementation of user_handle_single_line 
    # expects test data in following order: test1_run1, test2_run1, test1_run2, test2_run2, ...
    # If test suite outputs data in different order (each test is run for several times, and only then
    # it runs the next one), then between each two note_next_test calls should be several store_

    def user_handle_single_line(line)
      # Extract test name
      matches = line.match(/^TEST=(.+)$/)
      if matches && matches.length == 2
        # When encountering the first line of the output of new test, switch test number
        note_next_test
        set_current_test_name(matches[1])
      end

      # Extract test value
      matches = line.match(/^SCORE=(\d+)/)
